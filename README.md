# Git Pull Request Practice

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account!

Then use the `git clone` command to copy down your forked version of the repository to your local machine!

Make some changes, like editing a file or adding more files.

Once you're done, `git commit` your changes with a descriptive changelog message using the `-m` flag.

And finally, make a Pull Request on the GitHub website.
